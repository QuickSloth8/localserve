# LocalServe - sharing files easily on LAN

The goal is to make a portable HTTP server, for sharing files easily on LAN.
The server should be fast, secure, and really easy to use.

## Features

* Wide configurations options: default, cmd flags.
* Configurable file serving.
* Simple & clear HTML UI.
* Preview before download.
* Automatic serve IP interface & address detection.
* Logging, and printing connections to std out.
* Auto-termination & remote termination


## Future Features

* [ ] Easily runnable app (double click), with easy configs access.
* [ ] Command completion.
* [ ] HTTPS.
* [ ] Client auth.
* [ ] Navigation to other directories in the OS (even out of the sub-tree scope).
* [ ] Prettier UI (CSS & JS), and probably a separate front-end.
* [ ] Config files support & custom configs saving and re-usage.
* [ ] Download all (optionally with compression).
* [ ] Cool UI related stuff, like animations, custom cursor, sounds.
